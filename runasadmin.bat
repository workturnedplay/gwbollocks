:: (nope:)disallow Ctrl+break, no effect, it still prompts: Terminate batch job (Y/N)?
::break off
::so, break off:
::Does not disable Ctrl+Break
::Does not prevent interruption
::Does not affect Ctrl+C at all
::Only controls whether Ctrl+Break sets the internal BREAK flag
::That flag is checked by certain batch commands (FOR, COPY, etc.) to decide whether to abort early.


:: ctrl+c is trapped by our .exe by putting the terminal in raw mode, thus this .bat won't sense it and ask to terminate batch job.
